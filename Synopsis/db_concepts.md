A Database is a logically coherent collection of related data. Should provide: A single source of information, a data model, data independence, concurrency control, data integrity, data security, a database management system. DBMS: isolates programs and data, prevents unauthorised access, represents complex data types and relationships, enforces integrity constraints, provides automatic backup and recovery.
A value is the smallest updatable part of a table, it is specified by the intersection of a row and column. A column is a set of values which can vary over time however the datatype of all values in column is the same. A column name is an attribute name. A row is a non empty set of values, it is also called a tuple. A table is termed a relation. DBMS provides: Simple data structures, Simple operators, a view mechanism, SQL support, Data independence, Dynamic data definition, Integrated database dictionary. It also facilitates: easier application development and data distribution support. It provides several views: External View (users/application programmers), conceptual view/schema, internal schema (describing physical structure of database). SQL (structured query language) defines 3 languages: Data Definition (definition of tables), Data Manipulation (manipulation of data in tables), Data Control Language (access control to data).
